# Self-Supervised-Fake-News-Detection-with-Multimodal-Test-Time-Adapatation-Setting.
Improved the state-of-the-art model accuracy in COSMOS paper by 4%.  Implemented a novel architecture that includes global features and local object features of the image and Text features for the self-supervised training using contrastive loss. ”Inspired-Test-Time-Adaptation” to adapt the model to data of different distributions during testing.
Here I have used the COSMOS dataset.
